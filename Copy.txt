In 1990, the telescope was used to discover the first ever known Exo-planets (Planets existing outside our own Solar System). It was also used to discover Neutron stars (stars that half half a million times more mass than Earth in an area equivalent to the size of Brooklyn, New York).

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] The Rockefeller Center is home to several iconic New York scenes. Radio City Music Hall was completed in the complex in December of 1932, and at the time was the largest theatre on Earth, larger even than those on Broadway.
